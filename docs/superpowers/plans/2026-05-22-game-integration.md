# Adaptive Learning Engine — Game Integration Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Wire the already-built, already-tested `src/engine/` module into the running app: call `initEngine()` once at startup, and for the **top 8 games** make difficulty come from `getNextDifficulty(skillId)` (instead of random or user-picked) and fire `recordAttempt({ skillId, correct, responseTime })` after **each in-game answer** (not just at game end). The remaining 12 games keep their current behavior in v1 (spec §10 risk note: "Integrate the top 8 games first. Remaining 12 can keep random difficulty in v1 and be migrated in v2.").

**Architecture:** The engine is a UI-free singleton imported **only** through `src/engine/engineAPI.js` (its public API is locked — do NOT redefine or re-import internals). Integration is additive: each game keeps its existing visual design, content, scoring, and XP flow untouched (spec §7 **Critical**: "zero changes to game content or visual design. Only the difficulty knob and answer-recording call change"). We introduce one tiny reusable pattern — a per-game `SKILLS` constant pulled from `GAME_SKILLS`, a `difficulty` initialized from `getNextDifficulty`, and a `recordAttempt(...)` fire-and-forget call inside each game's answer handler.

**Tech Stack:** React 19 + Vite 8, Zustand, React Router 7. Tests: Vitest 4 + `@testing-library/react` + `jsdom` (jsdom and Testing Library are **added by this plan**; Vitest + fake-indexeddb already exist from the engine-core plan).

**Spec reference:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-adaptive-learning-engine-design.md` — this plan implements the game-page portion of §7 ("Files modified" → "Each `src/pages/*Game.jsx`") and applies §4 (game→skill table) and §6.1 (adaptive difficulty bins) at the call sites. It honors §10's "top 8 first" risk mitigation.

**Engine API consumed (locked — implemented in `src/engine/engineAPI.js`, do NOT redefine):**

```js
await initEngine();                                       // once at app start (hydrates from IndexedDB)
getNextDifficulty(skillId);                               // -> 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
await recordAttempt({ skillId, correct, responseTime });  // per in-game answer; returns updated mastery (number)
```

Skill ids and the game→skill map come from `src/engine/knowledgeGraph.js`:

```js
import { GAME_SKILLS, SKILL_IDS } from '../engine/knowledgeGraph';
// GAME_SKILLS.ArithmeticGame === ['addition','subtraction'], GAME_SKILLS.MultiplicationMeteor === ['multiplication'], etc.
```

**Explicitly OUT of scope for this plan** (each is a later plan or already done): the engine core layers behind the public API (already built + tested — `masteryModel.js`, `decisionLayer.js`, `knowledgeGraph.js`), `src/store/usePlayerStore.js`'s `addXP` engine hook (deferred — see Open Questions; games call `recordAttempt` directly so XP flow stays untouched), StudentDashboard / TeacherDashboard widgets (§7 dashboard rows — separate plans), the **server-side** `/api/sync` `MASTERY_UPDATE` handler + Mongo schema fields + `syncEngine` op-type recognition (§7 server rows — owned by the sibling **backend-mastery-sync** plan), the DKT pipeline, and the 12 non-top-8 games (v2).

**IN scope (cross-plan producer this plan owns):** `engineAPI.recordAttempt` is extended to **enqueue** a `MASTERY_UPDATE` sync op whenever mastery changes (Task 3b). `engineAPI.js` is the public engine surface (not a locked internal layer), so editing it is permitted. The op's transport, server merge, and Mongo persistence are handled by the backend-mastery-sync plan; this plan only **produces** the op, mirroring how `usePlayerStore.addXP` already produces `GAME_SESSION` ops.

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `vitest.config.js` | Widen `include` to `.test.jsx` and add jsdom dep note | modify |
| `src/test/setupDom.js` | jsdom-only setup: jest-dom matchers + cleanup (new) | create |
| `src/App.jsx` | Call `initEngine()` once in the existing startup `useEffect` | modify |
| `src/engine/gameSkills.js` | Tiny helper: `skillForGame(name)` (primary skill picker) so games stay one-liners | create |
| `src/engine/gameSkills.test.js` | Unit test for the helper | create |
| `src/engine/engineAPI.js` | `recordAttempt` also enqueues a `MASTERY_UPDATE` sync op after `saveMasteryState` (Task 3b) | modify |
| `src/engine/engineAPI.sync.test.js` | Unit test: `recordAttempt` enqueues exactly one `MASTERY_UPDATE` op (Task 3b) | create |
| `src/pages/ArithmeticGame.jsx` | Difficulty default + `recordAttempt` on each answer | modify |
| `src/pages/MultiplicationMeteor.jsx` | `recordAttempt` per meteor hit/miss; difficulty unused (fixed gen) — see task | modify |
| `src/pages/FractionFrenzy.jsx` | `recordAttempt` per option click | modify |
| `src/pages/PatternPuzzle.jsx` | Difficulty seeds the matrix generator + `recordAttempt` per select | modify |
| `src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.jsx` | `recordAttempt` per answer | modify |
| `src/pages/FractionNinja.jsx` | `recordAttempt` per submit | modify |
| `src/pages/DecimalMall.jsx` | `recordAttempt` per submit | modify |
| `src/pages/IntegerMountain.jsx` | `recordAttempt` per submit | modify |
| `src/pages/ArithmeticGame.integration.test.jsx` | Difficulty-from-engine + recordAttempt-fires tests | create |
| `src/pages/FractionFrenzy.integration.test.jsx` | recordAttempt-fires test (option-click style) | create |
| `src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.integration.test.jsx` | recordAttempt-fires test (usePlayerStore style) | create |

**The reusable integration pattern (applied identically in all 8 games):**

```js
// 1. Import the public API + the game→skill map (NEVER engine internals).
import { getNextDifficulty, recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';

// 2. Declare the game's skill once (component-name key matches GAME_SKILLS).
const SKILL = skillForGame('ArithmeticGame'); // -> 'addition'  (primary skill)

// 3. Seed difficulty from the engine instead of random / hardcoded.
const [difficulty, setDifficulty] = useState(() => getNextDifficulty(SKILL)); // 'easy'|'medium'|'hard'

// 4. After EACH answer, record it (fire-and-forget — never await in a UI handler).
recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct, responseTime });
```

Rationale for `skillForGame` over inlining a `SKILLS` array per game: §4 maps some games to two skills (e.g. `ArithmeticGame → ['addition','subtraction']`). For difficulty *and* per-answer recording we need **one** skill id. `skillForGame` returns the first (primary) skill, keeping every game a one-liner and keeping the multi-skill source of truth in `knowledgeGraph.js`. Games whose two skills are genuinely interleaved per question (none in this top-8 batch) can still call `recordAttempt` with a per-question skill — but for the top 8 a single primary skill is correct (verified per game in each task below).

---

### Task 1: Test tooling for components (Testing Library + jsdom)

The engine-core plan added Vitest (`environment: 'node'`) + fake-indexeddb. Component tests need a DOM. Add `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`, and `jsdom`, then make the runner pick up `.test.jsx` files and run them under jsdom **per-file** (so the existing Node-env engine tests are unaffected).

**Files:**
- Modify: `package.json` (devDependencies — via npm)
- Modify: `vitest.config.js`
- Create: `src/test/setupDom.js`
- Create: `src/pages/sanity.dom.test.jsx` (temporary; deleted at end of task)

- [ ] **Step 1: Install dev dependencies**

This repo's `npm install` fails on the `vite@^8` vs `vite-plugin-pwa` peer conflict, so `--legacy-peer-deps` is **required**:
```bash
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom --legacy-peer-deps
```
Expected: installs succeed and `package.json` `devDependencies` gains the four packages. If npm still errors, re-run the exact same command (it is idempotent); record the working command in the commit message.

- [ ] **Step 2: Widen the Vitest `include` and keep Node the default env**

Edit `vitest.config.js`. The current file is:
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'node',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.js'],
    include: ['src/**/*.test.js'],
  },
});
```
Replace it with (adds the React plugin so JSX compiles, widens `include` to `.jsx`, registers the DOM setup file, and keeps `node` as the default env — component test files opt into jsdom via a per-file pragma in Step 4):
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'node',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.js', './src/test/setupDom.js'],
    include: ['src/**/*.test.{js,jsx}'],
  },
});
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Create the DOM setup file**

Create `src/test/setupDom.js`:
```js
// Loaded for every test file, but its jest-dom matchers + cleanup only have effect
// when the file opts into the jsdom environment via `// @vitest-environment jsdom`.
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';
import { afterEach } from 'vitest';
import { cleanup } from '@testing-library/react';

afterEach(() => {
  cleanup();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write a sanity DOM test, run it, then delete it**

Create `src/pages/sanity.dom.test.jsx`:
```jsx
// @vitest-environment jsdom
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

function Hello() {
  return <h1>hello dom</h1>;
}

describe('component test tooling', () => {
  it('renders a component into jsdom', () => {
    render(<Hello />);
    expect(screen.getByText('hello dom')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
Run:
```bash
npm test -- sanity.dom
```
Expected: PASS (1 passed). Confirm the engine tests still pass under Node:
```bash
npm test
```
Expected: PASS (all engine + db + sanity files green). Then delete the sanity file:
```bash
rm src/pages/sanity.dom.test.jsx
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json vitest.config.js src/test/setupDom.js
git commit -m "chore: add testing-library + jsdom for component tests"
```

### Task 2: `skillForGame` helper

A one-line indirection so every game stays a one-liner and the multi-skill source of truth stays in `knowledgeGraph.js`. Returns the **primary** (first) skill a game exercises.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/engine/gameSkills.js`
- Test: `src/engine/gameSkills.test.js`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `src/engine/gameSkills.test.js`:
```js
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { skillForGame, skillsForGame } from './gameSkills';
import { SKILL_IDS } from './knowledgeGraph';

describe('gameSkills', () => {
  it('returns the primary (first) skill for a game', () => {
    expect(skillForGame('ArithmeticGame')).toBe('addition');
    expect(skillForGame('MultiplicationMeteor')).toBe('multiplication');
    expect(skillForGame('FractionFrenzy')).toBe('fractions-basic');
    expect(skillForGame('PatternPuzzle')).toBe('patterns');
    expect(skillForGame('MultiplicationFarm')).toBe('multiplication');
    expect(skillForGame('FractionNinja')).toBe('fractions-basic');
    expect(skillForGame('DecimalMall')).toBe('decimals');
    expect(skillForGame('IntegerMountain')).toBe('integers');
  });

  it('returns the full skill list for a game', () => {
    expect(skillsForGame('ArithmeticGame')).toEqual(['addition', 'subtraction']);
    expect(skillsForGame('FractionNinja')).toEqual(['fractions-basic', 'equiv-fractions']);
  });

  it('every primary skill is a valid skill id', () => {
    for (const game of ['ArithmeticGame', 'MultiplicationMeteor', 'FractionFrenzy',
      'PatternPuzzle', 'MultiplicationFarm', 'FractionNinja', 'DecimalMall', 'IntegerMountain']) {
      expect(SKILL_IDS).toContain(skillForGame(game));
    }
  });

  it('throws for an unknown game name (typo guard)', () => {
    expect(() => skillForGame('NotARealGame')).toThrow(/unknown game/i);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
npm test -- gameSkills
```
Expected: FAIL ("Failed to resolve import ./gameSkills" / functions undefined).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Create `src/engine/gameSkills.js`:
```js
// Thin convenience over GAME_SKILLS so game pages stay one-liners and the
// multi-skill source of truth remains in knowledgeGraph.js. UI imports the
// public engine API for behavior; this is the only graph helper games need.
import { GAME_SKILLS } from './knowledgeGraph';

// All skills a game exercises (spec §4 game→skill table).
export function skillsForGame(gameName) {
  const skills = GAME_SKILLS[gameName];
  if (!skills) throw new Error(`gameSkills: unknown game "${gameName}"`);
  return skills;
}

// The primary (first) skill — used for difficulty selection and per-answer recording.
export function skillForGame(gameName) {
  return skillsForGame(gameName)[0];
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
npm test -- gameSkills
```
Expected: PASS (all assertions).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/engine/gameSkills.js src/engine/gameSkills.test.js
git commit -m "feat(engine): add skillForGame helper for game integration"
```

### Task 3: Initialize the engine once at app start

`initEngine()` hydrates the engine singleton from IndexedDB and must run exactly once, before any game reads difficulty or records an attempt. `App.jsx` already has a single startup `useEffect` (it calls `initSyncEngine`, `initListeners`, `hydrate`); add `initEngine()` there. `main.jsx` is rejected because it has no effect hook and runs before the Router mounts — `App.jsx` is the established init site.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/App.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the import**

In `src/App.jsx`, the existing imports include:
```js
import { initSyncEngine } from './lib/syncEngine';
```
Add directly below it:
```js
import { initEngine } from './engine/engineAPI';
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Call `initEngine()` in the existing startup effect**

The current effect is:
```js
  useEffect(() => {
    // Init offline sync engine
    initSyncEngine(setStatus);
    // Init online/offline listeners
    initListeners();
    // Hydrate player data from IndexedDB
    hydrate();
  }, []);
```
Replace it with (adds the one call; `initEngine` returns a promise we intentionally do not await — games default to `'easy'`/prior mastery until hydration resolves a few ms later, which is correct cold-start behavior):
```js
  useEffect(() => {
    // Init offline sync engine
    initSyncEngine(setStatus);
    // Init online/offline listeners
    initListeners();
    // Hydrate player data from IndexedDB
    hydrate();
    // Hydrate the adaptive learning engine from IndexedDB (once, at startup)
    initEngine().catch(() => {});
  }, []);
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the app still builds**

```bash
npm run build
```
Expected: build succeeds. (No runtime assertion here — engine hydration is exercised by the engine-core tests; this step only confirms the import path resolves and the bundle compiles.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/App.jsx
git commit -m "feat(app): initialize adaptive engine once at startup"
```

### Task 3b: Enqueue a `MASTERY_UPDATE` sync op when mastery changes (engineAPI producer)

**Why this lives here (cross-plan contract):** The whole point of Tasks 4–11 is that playing a game updates mastery. But today `engineAPI.recordAttempt` (verified, current source) calls `appendInteraction(...)` + `saveMasteryState(s)` and then **stops** — it never tells the offline sync queue that mastery changed, so a student's mastery never reaches the server. The sibling **backend-mastery-sync** plan adds (a) the `masteryState`/`interactionLog` Mongo fields, (b) the additive `/api/sync` merge, and (c) the `MASTERY_UPDATE` op recognition in `syncEngine.sendToAPI`, and it **explicitly defers the producer to this plan** (backend plan, verbatim: *"The producer side (pushing a `MASTERY_UPDATE` op when the engine saves) belongs to the engine-wiring plan … that plan will call `pushToSyncQueue({ type: SYNC_OP_TYPES.MASTERY_UPDATE, payload: { masteryState, interactionLog } })`"*). This task is that producer. It is the natural owner because every game integrated in Tasks 4–11 flows through `recordAttempt`, so wiring the producer once here covers all 8 games (and the 12 v2 games later) with no per-game code.

`engineAPI.js` is **NOT** frozen (the engine *core layers* are locked behind the public API, but `engineAPI.js` itself is the public surface this plan is allowed to extend — see the engine README "Import only from `engineAPI.js`"; we are editing that file, not its internals). The edit is additive: one import + one `pushToSyncQueue(...)` call right after the existing `saveMasteryState(s)`.

**Payload contract (must match the backend consumer exactly):**
- Op shape mirrors the existing `GAME_SESSION` push at `usePlayerStore.js:133` → `{ type: 'MASTERY_UPDATE', payload: { masteryState: <saved state> } }`.
- The `payload.masteryState` **key** is consumed by the backend plan's `/api/sync` handler, which destructures `masteryState` from the POST body (`syncEngine.sendToAPI` POSTs `operation.payload` directly) and persists it into the Mongo `Progress.masteryState` (`Schema.Types.Mixed`) field. The **value** is the exact object the engine just saved — `{ belief, attempts, lastPracticed, review }` — i.e. the same `s` passed to `saveMasteryState(s)` and the same shape `loadMasteryState()` returns. This is byte-for-byte the round-trip the backend plan's "persists masteryState (MASTERY_UPDATE payload)" test asserts.
- We use the **string literal** `'MASTERY_UPDATE'` (not `SYNC_OP_TYPES.MASTERY_UPDATE`) so this plan stays self-contained and does not hard-depend on the `SYNC_OP_TYPES` constant the backend plan adds to `syncEngine.js`. The literal equals that constant's value (`SYNC_OP_TYPES.MASTERY_UPDATE === 'MASTERY_UPDATE'`), so the two plans interoperate in either merge order.
- `interactionLog` is intentionally **omitted** from the payload: the backend `/api/sync` merge is additive (it only writes keys present in the body), `interactionLog` defaults to `[]` server-side, and the engine does not keep an in-memory interaction array (it appends to IndexedDB one row at a time). Shipping `masteryState` alone is correct and matches the backend's "only the keys present in the body" semantics. (If a later plan wants the full DKT sequence on the server, it can extend this payload — flagged in Open Questions.)

**Fire-and-forget:** `recordAttempt` already `await`s `saveMasteryState`. `pushToSyncQueue` is also async; we `await` it too (we are already in an async function and the two writes are independent IndexedDB `put`/`add`s). This keeps `recordAttempt`'s contract identical: it still resolves to the mastery number after both writes complete.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/engine/engineAPI.js`
- Create: `src/engine/engineAPI.sync.test.js`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

This is a new file (not the engine-core `engineAPI.test.js`, which is owned by the engine-core plan — we add a sibling file so we never touch the locked suite). It runs under the **default Node env** with `fake-indexeddb` (already wired in `src/test/setup.js`), so `pushToSyncQueue` writes to a real in-memory `sync_queue`. Create `src/engine/engineAPI.sync.test.js`:
```js
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { resetEngine, recordAttempt } from './engineAPI';
import { getAllSyncQueueItems, getDB } from '../lib/db';

// Clear the sync_queue between tests so the count assertion is exact.
async function clearSyncQueue() {
  const db = await getDB();
  await db.clear('sync_queue');
}

describe('engineAPI -> sync queue producer', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    resetEngine();
    await clearSyncQueue();
  });

  it('enqueues exactly one MASTERY_UPDATE op per recordAttempt', async () => {
    await recordAttempt({ skillId: 'addition', correct: true });

    const items = await getAllSyncQueueItems();
    const mastery = items.filter((i) => i.type === 'MASTERY_UPDATE');
    expect(mastery).toHaveLength(1);
  });

  it('ships the saved mastery state (belief/attempts/...) under payload.masteryState', async () => {
    await recordAttempt({ skillId: 'addition', correct: true });

    const [op] = (await getAllSyncQueueItems()).filter((i) => i.type === 'MASTERY_UPDATE');
    expect(op.payload).toBeTruthy();
    expect(op.payload.masteryState).toBeTruthy();
    // Same shape the engine persists via saveMasteryState / loadMasteryState.
    expect(op.payload.masteryState).toHaveProperty('belief');
    expect(op.payload.masteryState).toHaveProperty('attempts');
    expect(op.payload.masteryState.attempts.addition).toBe(1);
  });

  it('enqueues one MASTERY_UPDATE per attempt (two attempts -> two ops)', async () => {
    await recordAttempt({ skillId: 'addition', correct: true });
    await recordAttempt({ skillId: 'addition', correct: false });

    const items = await getAllSyncQueueItems();
    expect(items.filter((i) => i.type === 'MASTERY_UPDATE')).toHaveLength(2);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test to verify it fails**

```bash
npm test -- engineAPI.sync
```
Expected: FAIL — `recordAttempt` does not enqueue anything yet, so `mastery` is empty (`expected length 1, got 0`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Modify `recordAttempt` to enqueue the op**

In `src/engine/engineAPI.js`, the current db import block is:
```js
import {
  loadMasteryState,
  saveMasteryState,
  appendInteraction,
} from '../lib/db';
```
Replace it with (add `pushToSyncQueue`):
```js
import {
  loadMasteryState,
  saveMasteryState,
  appendInteraction,
  pushToSyncQueue,
} from '../lib/db';
```

The current `recordAttempt` tail is:
```js
  await appendInteraction({ skillId, correct, responseTime, timestamp: now });
  await saveMasteryState(s);
  return mastery;
}
```
Replace it with (enqueue a MASTERY_UPDATE op carrying the just-saved state, right after `saveMasteryState`):
```js
  await appendInteraction({ skillId, correct, responseTime, timestamp: now });
  await saveMasteryState(s);
  // Tell the offline sync queue that mastery changed so it ships to /api/sync.
  // Payload key `masteryState` and shape ({ belief, attempts, lastPracticed, review })
  // match the backend MASTERY_UPDATE handler (sibling backend-mastery-sync plan).
  await pushToSyncQueue({ type: 'MASTERY_UPDATE', payload: { masteryState: s } });
  return mastery;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test to verify it passes**

```bash
npm test -- engineAPI.sync
```
Expected: PASS (all 3 assertions).

- [ ] **Step 5: Confirm the engine-core suite still passes (engineAPI is shared)**

This edit changes `recordAttempt`, which the **locked** engine-core suite exercises. Re-run the whole suite to prove no regression:
```bash
npm test
```
Expected: PASS — all engine-core tests (`engineAPI.test.js`, `decisionLayer.test.js`, `knowledgeGraph.test.js`, `masteryModel.test.js`), `db.mastery.test.js`, the new `gameSkills.test.js`, and `engineAPI.sync.test.js` green, 0 failures. (The engine-core `engineAPI.test.js` does **not** assert on the sync queue, and `recordAttempt` still returns the same mastery number, so adding an extra IndexedDB write does not change any existing assertion.)

> **Test-isolation note:** the engine-core `engineAPI.test.js` runs in the same `fake-indexeddb` instance. Its assertions check mastery/difficulty/reviews, never the `sync_queue`, so the extra enqueue is invisible to it. The new `engineAPI.sync.test.js` clears `sync_queue` in `beforeEach`, so its counts stay exact regardless of test ordering.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/engine/engineAPI.js src/engine/engineAPI.sync.test.js
git commit -m "feat(engine): enqueue MASTERY_UPDATE sync op on recordAttempt"
```

### Task 4: ArithmeticGame — difficulty from engine + per-answer recording

`ArithmeticGame` (route `/games/arithmetic`, `useGamification`) currently lets the user pick difficulty via three buttons and seeds `useState('easy')`. We **keep the buttons** (visual design is untouched — spec §7 Critical) but change the *initial* difficulty to the engine's recommendation, and we record every answer in `handleSubmit`. Skill: `skillForGame('ArithmeticGame') === 'addition'` (primary of `['addition','subtraction']`; both are arithmetic, addition is the canonical generator skill).

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/ArithmeticGame.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports**

The current top of `src/pages/ArithmeticGame.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { ChevronLeft, Timer, Check, X, Award, Flame } from 'lucide-react';

const GAME_DURATION = 30;
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { getNextDifficulty, recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';
import { ChevronLeft, Timer, Check, X, Award, Flame } from 'lucide-react';

const GAME_DURATION = 30;
const SKILL = skillForGame('ArithmeticGame'); // 'addition'
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Seed difficulty from the engine**

The current difficulty state is:
```js
  const [difficulty, setDifficulty] = useState('easy'); // easy, medium, hard
```
Replace it with (engine recommendation as the default; the user can still override with the buttons):
```js
  const [difficulty, setDifficulty] = useState(() => getNextDifficulty(SKILL)); // 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Track answer start time for `responseTime`**

The current state block ends with:
```js
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState(null); // 'correct' or 'wrong'
  
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
```
Replace it with (adds a ref to time each answer):
```js
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState(null); // 'correct' or 'wrong'

  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  const questionStartRef = useRef(Date.now());
```

In `startGame`, the current body sets up the first question:
```js
  const startGame = () => {
    setIsPlaying(true);
    setTimeLeft(GAME_DURATION);
    setScore(0);
    setCombo(0);
    setInputValue('');
    setCurrentQuestion(generateQuestion(difficulty));
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (inputRef.current) inputRef.current.focus();
    }, 100);
  };
```
Replace it with (start the timer for the first question):
```js
  const startGame = () => {
    setIsPlaying(true);
    setTimeLeft(GAME_DURATION);
    setScore(0);
    setCombo(0);
    setInputValue('');
    setCurrentQuestion(generateQuestion(difficulty));
    questionStartRef.current = Date.now();
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (inputRef.current) inputRef.current.focus();
    }, 100);
  };
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Record the attempt inside `handleSubmit`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!isPlaying) return;

    if (parseInt(inputValue) === currentQuestion.a) {
      setScore(score + 1);
      setCombo(c => c + 1);
      setFeedback('correct');
    } else {
      setCombo(0); // Break combo
      setFeedback('wrong');
    }

    setInputValue('');
    setCurrentQuestion(generateQuestion(difficulty));
    
    setTimeout(() => setFeedback(null), 300);
  };
```
Replace it with (record correctness + responseTime per answer; fire-and-forget, then reset the timer for the next question):
```js
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!isPlaying) return;

    const correct = parseInt(inputValue) === currentQuestion.a;
    const responseTime = Date.now() - questionStartRef.current;
    recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct, responseTime });

    if (correct) {
      setScore(score + 1);
      setCombo(c => c + 1);
      setFeedback('correct');
    } else {
      setCombo(0); // Break combo
      setFeedback('wrong');
    }

    setInputValue('');
    setCurrentQuestion(generateQuestion(difficulty));
    questionStartRef.current = Date.now();

    setTimeout(() => setFeedback(null), 300);
  };
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify build + lint**

> **Lint baseline is RED in this repo** (verified: `npm run lint` currently exits non-zero with 65 pre-existing errors across `Profile.jsx`, `StudentDashboard.jsx`, `TeacherDashboard.jsx`, `useSyncStore.js`, etc.). Running the whole-repo `npm run lint` will therefore fail on code this task never touched. To verify *this task* introduced no new lint errors, lint **only the changed file** with `npx eslint`:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/ArithmeticGame.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds; `npx eslint src/pages/ArithmeticGame.jsx` is clean (this file had 0 lint errors at baseline, so it must stay at 0). (Behavioral verification is the integration test in Task 12.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/ArithmeticGame.jsx
git commit -m "feat(game): adaptive difficulty + per-answer recording in ArithmeticGame"
```

### Task 5: MultiplicationMeteor — per-answer recording

`MultiplicationMeteor` (route `/games/meteor`, `useGamification`) generates fixed-range problems (`generateProblem` has no difficulty parameter) and the player types answers that destroy meteors. There is **no difficulty knob to wire** — its visual/physics design must stay untouched (spec §7 Critical), so we only add `recordAttempt`. A submission is **correct** when it matches a meteor's answer (`hitMeteorIndex !== -1`) and **incorrect** otherwise (a wrong/no-match guess). Skill: `'multiplication'`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/MultiplicationMeteor.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports**

The current top of `src/pages/MultiplicationMeteor.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { ChevronLeft, Rocket, Shield, Crosshair, Flame } from 'lucide-react';
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';
import { ChevronLeft, Rocket, Shield, Crosshair, Flame } from 'lucide-react';

const SKILL = skillForGame('MultiplicationMeteor'); // 'multiplication'
```

> Note: this game has no difficulty parameter (fixed `generateProblem`), so `getNextDifficulty` is intentionally **not** imported here — wiring it would require changing the problem generator and thus the game's content/feel, which §7 forbids. Recording attempts still feeds mastery; difficulty adapts in games that already expose the knob (Tasks 4, 7).

- [ ] **Step 2: Record the attempt inside `handleSubmit`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!isPlaying) return;
    
    const ans = parseInt(inputValue);
    const hitMeteorIndex = meteors.findIndex(m => m.a === ans);
    
    if (hitMeteorIndex !== -1) {
      const target = meteors[hitMeteorIndex];
      
      // Calculate laser angle
      const dx = target.left - 50;
      const dy = 100 - target.top;
      const angle = Math.atan2(dx, dy) * (180 / Math.PI);

      const hitId = Date.now();
      
      // Spawn laser & explosion visuals
      setLasers(prev => [...prev, { id: hitId, angle }]);
      setExplosions(prev => [...prev, { id: hitId, top: target.top, left: target.left, type: 'destroy' }]);
      setTurretAngle(angle);
      
      // Remove visual effects after 300ms
      setTimeout(() => {
         setLasers(prev => prev.filter(l => l.id !== hitId));
         setExplosions(prev => prev.filter(ex => ex.id !== hitId));
         setTurretAngle(0); // Reset turret to face forward after firing lock
      }, 300);

      setMeteors(prev => prev.filter((_, idx) => idx !== hitMeteorIndex));
      setScore(s => s + 1);
    }
    setInputValue('');
  };
```
Replace it with (record a hit as correct, a non-matching guess as incorrect; ignore empty submissions so an accidental Enter on an empty field is not logged as a miss):
```js
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!isPlaying) return;

    const ans = parseInt(inputValue);
    if (Number.isNaN(ans)) { setInputValue(''); return; } // empty/invalid: don't record

    const hitMeteorIndex = meteors.findIndex(m => m.a === ans);
    recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct: hitMeteorIndex !== -1, responseTime: 0 });

    if (hitMeteorIndex !== -1) {
      const target = meteors[hitMeteorIndex];

      // Calculate laser angle
      const dx = target.left - 50;
      const dy = 100 - target.top;
      const angle = Math.atan2(dx, dy) * (180 / Math.PI);

      const hitId = Date.now();

      // Spawn laser & explosion visuals
      setLasers(prev => [...prev, { id: hitId, angle }]);
      setExplosions(prev => [...prev, { id: hitId, top: target.top, left: target.left, type: 'destroy' }]);
      setTurretAngle(angle);

      // Remove visual effects after 300ms
      setTimeout(() => {
         setLasers(prev => prev.filter(l => l.id !== hitId));
         setExplosions(prev => prev.filter(ex => ex.id !== hitId));
         setTurretAngle(0); // Reset turret to face forward after firing lock
      }, 300);

      setMeteors(prev => prev.filter((_, idx) => idx !== hitMeteorIndex));
      setScore(s => s + 1);
    }
    setInputValue('');
  };
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify build + lint**

> Whole-repo `npm run lint` is RED at baseline (see Task 4 Step 5). Lint only the changed file:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/MultiplicationMeteor.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds; `npx eslint src/pages/MultiplicationMeteor.jsx` is clean (0 errors at baseline → must stay 0).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/MultiplicationMeteor.jsx
git commit -m "feat(game): per-answer recording in MultiplicationMeteor"
```

### Task 6: FractionFrenzy — per-answer recording

`FractionFrenzy` (route `/games/fractions`, `useGamification`) is a 10-round multiple-choice match game (`handleOptionClick`). Generator (`generateDynamicQuestion`) has no difficulty parameter, so we add `recordAttempt` only (no `getNextDifficulty` — wiring it would change content). Skill: `'fractions-basic'`. Correctness already computed as `isCorrect`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/FractionFrenzy.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports**

The current top of `src/pages/FractionFrenzy.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { ChevronLeft, PieChart, Check, X, Award, Flame } from 'lucide-react';
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';
import { ChevronLeft, PieChart, Check, X, Award, Flame } from 'lucide-react';

const SKILL = skillForGame('FractionFrenzy'); // 'fractions-basic'
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Record the attempt inside `handleOptionClick`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleOptionClick = (option) => {
    if (feedback) return;
    const isCorrect = option.numerator === current.target.numerator && option.denominator === current.target.denominator;
    
    if (isCorrect) {
      setScore(s => s + 1);
      setStreak(s => s + 1);
      setFeedback('correct');
    } else {
      setStreak(0);
      setFeedback('wrong');
    }
```
Replace it with (record immediately when correctness is known):
```js
  const handleOptionClick = (option) => {
    if (feedback) return;
    const isCorrect = option.numerator === current.target.numerator && option.denominator === current.target.denominator;
    recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct: isCorrect, responseTime: 0 });

    if (isCorrect) {
      setScore(s => s + 1);
      setStreak(s => s + 1);
      setFeedback('correct');
    } else {
      setStreak(0);
      setFeedback('wrong');
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify build + lint**

> Whole-repo `npm run lint` is RED at baseline (see Task 4 Step 5). Lint only the changed file:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/FractionFrenzy.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds; `npx eslint src/pages/FractionFrenzy.jsx` is clean (0 errors at baseline → must stay 0).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/FractionFrenzy.jsx
git commit -m "feat(game): per-answer recording in FractionFrenzy"
```

### Task 7: PatternPuzzle — difficulty from engine + per-answer recording

`PatternPuzzle` (route `/games/patterns`, `useGamification`) is the one top-8 game whose generator **does** take a difficulty input: `generateMatrixPattern(difficultyLevel)` where a higher integer unlocks more pattern types. Currently it ramps an internal `levelTracker` (1..10) and feeds that as the difficulty. We seed the *starting* difficulty integer from the engine's `'easy'|'medium'|'hard'` while preserving the per-round ramp and all visuals. Skill: `'patterns'`. Correctness already computed as `opt === currentPattern.answer`.

Difficulty mapping (engine string → starting integer for `generateMatrixPattern`): `easy → 1`, `medium → 3`, `hard → 5`. These keep the existing 1..(levelTracker) ramp semantics; `maxIdx = min(5, 1 + floor(level/2))` so 1→1 type, 3→2 types, 5→3 types — a gentle, content-preserving lift.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/PatternPuzzle.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports + a difficulty→integer map**

The current top of `src/pages/PatternPuzzle.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { ChevronLeft, Puzzle, Award, RefreshCcw, Check, X, Sparkles, BrainCircuit, Grid3X3 } from 'lucide-react';
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useGamification } from '../hooks/useGamification';
import { getNextDifficulty, recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';
import { ChevronLeft, Puzzle, Award, RefreshCcw, Check, X, Sparkles, BrainCircuit, Grid3X3 } from 'lucide-react';

const SKILL = skillForGame('PatternPuzzle'); // 'patterns'
const DIFFICULTY_START = { easy: 1, medium: 3, hard: 5 }; // engine string -> starting matrix difficulty
function startLevelFromEngine() {
  return DIFFICULTY_START[getNextDifficulty(SKILL)] ?? 1;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Seed the starting difficulty from the engine**

The current state init is:
```js
  const TOTAL_ROUNDS = 10;
  const [levelTracker, setLevelTracker] = useState(1);
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [streak, setStreak] = useState(0);
  const [currentPattern, setCurrentPattern] = useState(generateMatrixPattern(1));
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState(null);
  const [gameOver, setGameOver] = useState(false);
```
Replace it with (lazy init so `getNextDifficulty` is read once on mount; the first matrix is generated at the engine-recommended difficulty):
```js
  const TOTAL_ROUNDS = 10;
  const [levelTracker, setLevelTracker] = useState(() => startLevelFromEngine());
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [streak, setStreak] = useState(0);
  const [currentPattern, setCurrentPattern] = useState(() => generateMatrixPattern(startLevelFromEngine()));
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState(null);
  const [gameOver, setGameOver] = useState(false);
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Re-seed difficulty on replay in `initGame`**

The current reset is:
```js
  const initGame = () => {
    setLevelTracker(1);
    setScore(0);
    setStreak(0);
    setGameOver(false);
    setCurrentPattern(generateMatrixPattern(1));
    setFeedback(null);
  };
```
Replace it with (replay uses the latest engine recommendation, which may have shifted after the previous round's recorded attempts):
```js
  const initGame = () => {
    const start = startLevelFromEngine();
    setLevelTracker(start);
    setScore(0);
    setStreak(0);
    setGameOver(false);
    setCurrentPattern(generateMatrixPattern(start));
    setFeedback(null);
  };
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Record the attempt inside `handleSelect`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleSelect = (opt) => {
    if (feedback) return;
    
    if (opt === currentPattern.answer) {
      setFeedback('correct');
      setScore(s => s + 1);
      setStreak(s => s + 1);
    } else {
      setFeedback('wrong');
      setStreak(0);
    }
```
Replace it with (record correctness per selection):
```js
  const handleSelect = (opt) => {
    if (feedback) return;
    const correct = opt === currentPattern.answer;
    recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct, responseTime: 0 });

    if (correct) {
      setFeedback('correct');
      setScore(s => s + 1);
      setStreak(s => s + 1);
    } else {
      setFeedback('wrong');
      setStreak(0);
    }
```

> The per-round ramp `generateMatrixPattern(levelTracker + 1)` inside `handleSelect`'s `setTimeout` is left **unchanged** — it continues to escalate from whatever start the engine chose, preserving the existing in-game progression. Only the *starting* point is now adaptive.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify build + lint**

> Whole-repo `npm run lint` is RED at baseline (see Task 4 Step 5). Lint only the changed file:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/PatternPuzzle.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds. **Pre-existing baseline note:** `PatternPuzzle.jsx` already had **exactly one** lint error at baseline — `1:20 'useEffect' is defined but never used` (the `useEffect` import is dead code that predates this plan). This task's import replacement **keeps** `useEffect` in the import list (it is part of the unchanged "before" line) and does **not** add a new `useEffect` usage, so this single pre-existing error persists and is acceptable. The acceptance bar is: `npx eslint src/pages/PatternPuzzle.jsx` reports **no more than** that one pre-existing `useEffect` error and **zero** new errors. (If you want a clean file, dropping `useEffect` from the import is a safe, content-neutral cleanup — but it is technically outside this plan's "additive only" scope, so leave it unless the team approves.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/PatternPuzzle.jsx
git commit -m "feat(game): adaptive starting difficulty + per-answer recording in PatternPuzzle"
```

### Task 8: MultiplicationFarm — per-answer recording

`MultiplicationFarm` (route `/games/farm-multiply`, `usePlayerStore`) is an 8-round multiple-choice game (`handleAnswer`). Generator (`genQ`) has no difficulty parameter → add `recordAttempt` only. Skill: `'multiplication'`. Correctness: `n === q.answer`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports**

The current top of `src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
import { recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';

const SKILL = skillForGame('MultiplicationFarm'); // 'multiplication'
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Record the attempt inside `handleAnswer`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleAnswer=(n)=>{
    if(selected!==null)return;
    setSelected(n);
    if(n===q.answer){
      setScore(s=>s+20);
      setFeedback({text:`✅ ${q.rows}×${q.cols}=${q.answer} crops!`,correct:true});
    }else{
      setFeedback({text:`❌ ${q.rows}×${q.cols}=${q.answer}`,correct:false});
    }
```
Replace it with (record correctness per choice):
```js
  const handleAnswer=(n)=>{
    if(selected!==null)return;
    setSelected(n);
    const correct=n===q.answer;
    recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct, responseTime: 0 });
    if(correct){
      setScore(s=>s+20);
      setFeedback({text:`✅ ${q.rows}×${q.cols}=${q.answer} crops!`,correct:true});
    }else{
      setFeedback({text:`❌ ${q.rows}×${q.cols}=${q.answer}`,correct:false});
    }
```

> Note the existing line below the handler — `if(round>=TOTAL_ROUNDS){...addXP(score+(n===q.answer?20:0),...)}` — is left unchanged; it still uses `n===q.answer` for the final XP bonus. We do not refactor it to `correct` to keep the diff minimal and the XP flow byte-identical.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify build + lint**

> Whole-repo `npm run lint` is RED at baseline (see Task 4 Step 5). Lint only the changed file:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds. **Pre-existing baseline note:** `MultiplicationFarm.jsx` already had **two** lint errors at baseline — `1:20 'useEffect' is defined but never used` and `2:10 'motion' is defined but never used` (both predate this plan; the "before" import lines are unchanged by this task). The acceptance bar is: `npx eslint src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.jsx` reports **no more than** those two pre-existing errors and **zero** new errors.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.jsx
git commit -m "feat(game): per-answer recording in MultiplicationFarm"
```

### Task 9: FractionNinja — per-answer recording

`FractionNinja` (route `/games/fraction-ninja`, `usePlayerStore`) is an 8-round "slice the roti" game; the answer is submitted once per round in `handleSubmit` where `correct = slashed.size === target`. No difficulty parameter → add `recordAttempt` only. Skill: `'fractions-basic'` (primary of `['fractions-basic','equiv-fractions']`).

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/FractionNinja.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports**

The current top of `src/pages/FractionNinja.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
import { recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';

const SKILL = skillForGame('FractionNinja'); // 'fractions-basic'
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Record the attempt inside `handleSubmit`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleSubmit=()=>{
    const correct=slashed.size===target;
    if(correct){
      setScore(s=>s+25);setFeedback({text:'🥷 Perfect Cut!',correct:true});
    }else{
      setFeedback({text:`❌ Need ${target} slices, you cut ${slashed.size}`,correct:false});
    }
```
Replace it with (record the round's correctness; `correct` is already in scope):
```js
  const handleSubmit=()=>{
    const correct=slashed.size===target;
    recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct, responseTime: 0 });
    if(correct){
      setScore(s=>s+25);setFeedback({text:'🥷 Perfect Cut!',correct:true});
    }else{
      setFeedback({text:`❌ Need ${target} slices, you cut ${slashed.size}`,correct:false});
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify build + lint**

> Whole-repo `npm run lint` is RED at baseline (see Task 4 Step 5). Lint only the changed file:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/FractionNinja.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds; `npx eslint src/pages/FractionNinja.jsx` is clean (0 errors at baseline → must stay 0).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/FractionNinja.jsx
git commit -m "feat(game): per-answer recording in FractionNinja"
```

### Task 10: DecimalMall — per-answer recording

`DecimalMall` (route `/games/decimal-mall`, `usePlayerStore`) is a 60-second timed fraction→decimal typing game; each `handleSubmit` is one answer with correctness `Math.abs(userAns - correct) < 0.015`. No difficulty parameter → add `recordAttempt` only. Skill: `'decimals'`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/DecimalMall.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports**

The current top of `src/pages/DecimalMall.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
import { recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';

const SKILL = skillForGame('DecimalMall'); // 'decimals'
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Record the attempt inside `handleSubmit`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleSubmit=(e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    if(gameState!=='playing')return;
    const userAns=parseFloat(input);
    const correct=parseFloat(q.decimal);
    if(Math.abs(userAns-correct)<0.015){
      const pts=15+combo*3;setScore(s=>s+pts);setCombo(c=>c+1);
      setFeedback({text:`✅ Correct! +${pts}`,correct:true});
    }else{
      setCombo(0);setFeedback({text:`❌ Answer: ${q.decimal}`,correct:false});
    }
    setInput('');
    setTimeout(()=>{setFeedback(null);setQ(genQ());},600);
  };
```
Note: the existing local `const correct` here holds the *expected decimal value*, not a boolean. To avoid shadowing confusion we compute a separate boolean `isCorrect` and record it; we also skip recording empty/invalid input. Replace the handler with:
```js
  const handleSubmit=(e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    if(gameState!=='playing')return;
    const userAns=parseFloat(input);
    const correct=parseFloat(q.decimal);
    const isCorrect=!Number.isNaN(userAns)&&Math.abs(userAns-correct)<0.015;
    if(!Number.isNaN(userAns)) recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct: isCorrect, responseTime: 0 });
    if(isCorrect){
      const pts=15+combo*3;setScore(s=>s+pts);setCombo(c=>c+1);
      setFeedback({text:`✅ Correct! +${pts}`,correct:true});
    }else{
      setCombo(0);setFeedback({text:`❌ Answer: ${q.decimal}`,correct:false});
    }
    setInput('');
    setTimeout(()=>{setFeedback(null);setQ(genQ());},600);
  };
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify build + lint**

> Whole-repo `npm run lint` is RED at baseline (see Task 4 Step 5). Lint only the changed file:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/DecimalMall.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds; `npx eslint src/pages/DecimalMall.jsx` is clean (0 errors at baseline → must stay 0).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash

### Task 11: IntegerMountain — per-answer recording

`IntegerMountain` (route `/games/integer-mountain`, `usePlayerStore`) is a 60-second timed integer-arithmetic climb; each `handleSubmit` is one answer with correctness `val === q.answer`. No difficulty parameter → add `recordAttempt` only. Skill: `'integers'`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/IntegerMountain.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the engine imports**

The current top of `src/pages/IntegerMountain.jsx` is:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
```
Replace it with:
```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { usePlayerStore } from '../store/usePlayerStore';
import { recordAttempt } from '../engine/engineAPI';
import { skillForGame } from '../engine/gameSkills';

const SKILL = skillForGame('IntegerMountain'); // 'integers'
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Record the attempt inside `handleSubmit`**

The current handler is:
```js
  const handleSubmit=(e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    if(gameState!=='playing')return;
    const val=parseInt(input,10);
    if(val===q.answer){
      setPosition(p=>Math.min(MOUNTAIN_HEIGHT,p+1));
      setScore(s=>s+20);
      setFeedback({text:'⛰️ Climb!',correct:true});
    }else{
      setPosition(p=>Math.max(0,p-1));
      setFeedback({text:`❌ Was ${q.answer}`,correct:false});
    }
    setInput('');
    setTimeout(()=>{setFeedback(null);setQ(genQ());},500);
  };
```
Replace it with (record correctness; skip empty/invalid input so a blank Enter isn't a logged miss):
```js
  const handleSubmit=(e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    if(gameState!=='playing')return;
    const val=parseInt(input,10);
    if(Number.isNaN(val)){setInput('');return;} // empty/invalid: don't record
    const correct=val===q.answer;
    recordAttempt({ skillId: SKILL, correct, responseTime: 0 });
    if(correct){
      setPosition(p=>Math.min(MOUNTAIN_HEIGHT,p+1));
      setScore(s=>s+20);
      setFeedback({text:'⛰️ Climb!',correct:true});
    }else{
      setPosition(p=>Math.max(0,p-1));
      setFeedback({text:`❌ Was ${q.answer}`,correct:false});
    }
    setInput('');
    setTimeout(()=>{setFeedback(null);setQ(genQ());},500);
  };
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify build + lint**

> Whole-repo `npm run lint` is RED at baseline (see Task 4 Step 5). Lint only the changed file:
```bash
npm run build && npx eslint src/pages/IntegerMountain.jsx
```
Expected: build succeeds; `npx eslint src/pages/IntegerMountain.jsx` is clean (0 errors at baseline → must stay 0).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/IntegerMountain.jsx
git commit -m "feat(game): per-answer recording in IntegerMountain"
```

### Task 12: Component tests — difficulty-from-engine + recordAttempt-fires

Three representative behavior tests cover the two integration shapes: (a) a typed-answer game that **also** seeds difficulty from the engine (`ArithmeticGame`), (b) an option-click `useGamification` game (`FractionFrenzy`), and (c) an option-click `usePlayerStore` game (`MultiplicationFarm`). Tests mock the engine module so we assert against the integration, not the BKT math (which the engine-core tests already cover). Each test file uses `// @vitest-environment jsdom`.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/pages/ArithmeticGame.integration.test.jsx`
- Create: `src/pages/FractionFrenzy.integration.test.jsx`
- Create: `src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.integration.test.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: ArithmeticGame test — difficulty comes from engine + recordAttempt fires**

Create `src/pages/ArithmeticGame.integration.test.jsx`:
```jsx
// @vitest-environment jsdom
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

// Mock the public engine API so we assert the integration, not the BKT math.
const getNextDifficulty = vi.fn(() => 'hard');
const recordAttempt = vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(0.5));
vi.mock('../engine/engineAPI', () => ({
  getNextDifficulty: (...a) => getNextDifficulty(...a),
  recordAttempt: (...a) => recordAttempt(...a),
}));

import ArithmeticGame from './ArithmeticGame';

function renderGame() {
  return render(
    <MemoryRouter>
      <ArithmeticGame />
    </MemoryRouter>
  );
}

describe('ArithmeticGame engine integration', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    getNextDifficulty.mockClear();
    recordAttempt.mockClear();
    getNextDifficulty.mockReturnValue('hard');
  });

  it('asks the engine for difficulty for the addition skill', () => {
    renderGame();
    expect(getNextDifficulty).toHaveBeenCalledWith('addition');
  });

  it('seeds the selected difficulty from the engine recommendation', () => {
    renderGame();
    // 'hard' -> the Hard button is the active (btn-primary) one on the start screen.
    const hardBtn = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /hard/i });
    expect(hardBtn.className).toContain('btn-primary');
  });

  it('records an attempt with the addition skill after an answer', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    renderGame();
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /start match/i }));

    // After Start, the answer input is present; type any value and submit (Enter).
    const input = await screen.findByPlaceholderText('?');
    await user.type(input, '7{enter}');

    expect(recordAttempt).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    const arg = recordAttempt.mock.calls[0][0];
    expect(arg.skillId).toBe('addition');
    expect(typeof arg.correct).toBe('boolean');
    expect(typeof arg.responseTime).toBe('number');
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: FractionFrenzy test — recordAttempt fires on option click**

Create `src/pages/FractionFrenzy.integration.test.jsx`:
```jsx
// @vitest-environment jsdom
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const recordAttempt = vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(0.5));
vi.mock('../engine/engineAPI', () => ({
  // FractionFrenzy imports only recordAttempt; provide getNextDifficulty as a no-op
  // so the module's import list resolves regardless of future edits.
  recordAttempt: (...a) => recordAttempt(...a),
  getNextDifficulty: () => 'easy',
}));

import FractionFrenzy from './FractionFrenzy';

describe('FractionFrenzy engine integration', () => {
  beforeEach(() => recordAttempt.mockClear());

  it('records an attempt with the fractions-basic skill on an option click', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(
      <MemoryRouter>
        <FractionFrenzy />
      </MemoryRouter>
    );

    // The game starts immediately (no start screen); the four fraction options are buttons.
    // Click the first answer option (the numerator/denominator buttons render as button roles).
    const optionButtons = screen.getAllByRole('button').filter((b) => b.className.includes('rounded-2xl'));
    expect(optionButtons.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    await user.click(optionButtons[0]);

    expect(recordAttempt).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    const arg = recordAttempt.mock.calls[0][0];
    expect(arg.skillId).toBe('fractions-basic');
    expect(typeof arg.correct).toBe('boolean');
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 3: MultiplicationFarm test — recordAttempt fires on option click (usePlayerStore game)**

Create `src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.integration.test.jsx`:
```jsx
// @vitest-environment jsdom
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const recordAttempt = vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(0.5));
vi.mock('../engine/engineAPI', () => ({
  recordAttempt: (...a) => recordAttempt(...a),
  getNextDifficulty: () => 'easy',
}));

import MultiplicationFarm from './MultiplicationFarm';

describe('MultiplicationFarm engine integration', () => {
  beforeEach(() => recordAttempt.mockClear());

  it('records an attempt with the multiplication skill on an answer choice', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(
      <MemoryRouter>
        <MultiplicationFarm />
      </MemoryRouter>
    );

    // Four numeric answer buttons render in a grid; click the first.
    const answerButtons = screen.getAllByRole('button').filter((b) => /^\d+$/.test(b.textContent.trim()));
    expect(answerButtons.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    await user.click(answerButtons[0]);

    expect(recordAttempt).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    const arg = recordAttempt.mock.calls[0][0];
    expect(arg.skillId).toBe('multiplication');
    expect(typeof arg.correct).toBe('boolean');
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the new component tests**

```bash
npm test -- integration
```
Expected: PASS (3 files, all assertions). If the option-button `.filter` selectors do not match (because Tailwind class names shifted), debug by logging `screen.debug()` in the failing test and adjust the selector to target a stable attribute — do **not** change the game's markup to suit the test.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the full suite (engine + db + game integration)**

```bash
npm test
```
Expected: PASS — engine-core tests (Node env) and game integration tests (jsdom env) all green, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/pages/ArithmeticGame.integration.test.jsx src/pages/FractionFrenzy.integration.test.jsx src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.integration.test.jsx
git commit -m "test(game): verify difficulty-from-engine and recordAttempt firing"
```

---

### Task 13: Full verification

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the full test suite**

```bash
npm test
```
Expected: PASS, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 2: Lint (scoped to changed files — whole-repo lint is RED at baseline)**

> `npm run lint` over the whole repo exits non-zero on **65 pre-existing errors** that this plan never touches (`Profile.jsx`, `StudentDashboard.jsx`, `TeacherDashboard.jsx`, `useSyncStore.js`, plus pre-existing dead-import errors in `MultiplicationFarm.jsx` and `PatternPuzzle.jsx`). Do **not** gate this plan on a green whole-repo lint. Instead lint exactly the files this plan creates/modifies:
```bash
npx eslint src/App.jsx src/engine/gameSkills.js src/engine/engineAPI.js \
  src/pages/ArithmeticGame.jsx src/pages/MultiplicationMeteor.jsx \
  src/pages/FractionFrenzy.jsx src/pages/PatternPuzzle.jsx \
  src/pages/MultiplicationFarm.jsx src/pages/FractionNinja.jsx \
  src/pages/DecimalMall.jsx src/pages/IntegerMountain.jsx
```
Expected: **zero new errors**. Two files carry pre-existing dead-import errors that are out of this plan's additive scope and must remain the only errors reported:
- `MultiplicationFarm.jsx` — `useEffect` + `motion` unused (2 pre-existing errors).
- `PatternPuzzle.jsx` — `useEffect` unused (1 pre-existing error).
All other listed files (incl. `App.jsx`, `gameSkills.js`, `engineAPI.js`, and the other 6 games) must be **clean (0 errors)**.

- [ ] **Step 3: Build**

```bash
npm run build
```
Expected: build succeeds (the 8 games now import from `src/engine/engineAPI`, pulling the engine into the bundle for the first time — confirm no resolution or tree-shake errors).

- [ ] **Step 4: Manual smoke (optional but recommended)**

```bash
npm run dev
```
Then in the browser, play each of the 8 games once and confirm: (a) the game looks/plays identically to before (no visual change — §7 Critical), (b) DevTools → Application → IndexedDB shows `mastery_state` updating and `interaction_log` growing as you answer. No console errors from the engine.

- [ ] **Step 5: Final commit (if any uncommitted verification fixes)**

```bash
git status   # expect clean; commit only if a verification step required a fix
```

---

## Self-Review

**1. Spec coverage (Game Integration slice):**
- §7 "Each `src/pages/*Game.jsx`" → (a) declare game's skill, (b) replace random/picked difficulty with engine difficulty, (c) `recordAttempt` after each in-game answer → Tasks 4–11 (top 8). ✅
- §4 game→skill table → consumed via `GAME_SKILLS`/`skillForGame` (Task 2); each game's skill verified against the table in its task header. ✅
- §6.1 difficulty bins (`easy/medium/hard`) → consumed verbatim from `getNextDifficulty` (Tasks 4, 7; games already use these exact strings). ✅
- §10 "integrate top 8 first; remaining 12 keep current behavior in v1" → exactly 8 games modified; 12 untouched. ✅
- §7 **Critical** "zero changes to game content or visual design" → every task is additive (imports + one `recordAttempt` call + difficulty *default* only); no markup/JSX/styling/scoring/XP changed. Each task explicitly preserves the existing generators and XP calls. ✅
- `initEngine()` once at startup → Task 3 (in `App.jsx`'s existing effect; rationale for App over main.jsx documented). ✅
- §7 server-sync producer "client enqueues `MASTERY_UPDATE` when mastery changes" → Task 3b extends `engineAPI.recordAttempt` to `pushToSyncQueue({ type: 'MASTERY_UPDATE', payload: { masteryState: s } })` right after `saveMasteryState`. Payload key/shape matches the sibling backend-mastery-sync `/api/sync` handler. ✅

**2. Placeholder scan:** No "TBD" / "similar to above" / "add error handling later". Every modify step shows the exact current code and the exact replacement, in full. Every create step has complete file contents. ✅

**3. Type / name consistency:**
- Public API names used identically everywhere: `initEngine`, `getNextDifficulty`, `recordAttempt` — matched against `src/engine/engineAPI.js` (read; exact match). ✅
- `recordAttempt` argument shape `{ skillId, correct, responseTime }` consistent across all 8 games and all tests, matching the engine's locked signature. ✅
- `skillForGame(name)` keys are component names matching `GAME_SKILLS` keys in `knowledgeGraph.js` exactly: `ArithmeticGame`, `MultiplicationMeteor`, `FractionFrenzy`, `PatternPuzzle`, `MultiplicationFarm`, `FractionNinja`, `DecimalMall`, `IntegerMountain` (read; exact match). ✅
- Difficulty strings `'easy'|'medium'|'hard'` match what the games already use and what `getNextDifficulty` returns. ✅
- Import paths: games live in `src/pages/`, so `../engine/engineAPI` and `../engine/gameSkills` are correct relative paths (verified against existing `../store/...` and `../hooks/...` imports). ✅
- Test env: `vitest.config.js` default stays `node` (engine tests unaffected); component tests opt into jsdom via `// @vitest-environment jsdom` and the `include` glob widened to `.test.{js,jsx}`. ✅
- `npm install` uses `--legacy-peer-deps` (vite 8 vs vite-plugin-pwa peer conflict) — stated in Task 1. ✅
- `MASTERY_UPDATE` op shape `{ type: 'MASTERY_UPDATE', payload: { masteryState: <{ belief, attempts, lastPracticed, review }> } }` matches: (a) the existing `GAME_SESSION` push pattern in `usePlayerStore.js:133`, (b) `syncEngine.sendToAPI` (POSTs `operation.payload`), and (c) the backend plan's `/api/sync` `masteryState` key + `Progress.masteryState` Mixed field. Verified against `src/lib/db.js` `pushToSyncQueue`, `src/lib/syncEngine.js`, and the sibling plan's Task 4/Task 6. ✅

**5. Lint reality (verified by running `npm run lint`):** The whole-repo lint is **RED at baseline** (65 errors, 10 warnings) in files this plan never touches (`Profile.jsx`, `StudentDashboard.jsx`, `TeacherDashboard.jsx`, `useSyncStore.js`) plus two pre-existing dead-import errors inside touched games (`MultiplicationFarm.jsx`: `useEffect`+`motion`; `PatternPuzzle.jsx`: `useEffect`). Therefore every verification step uses **`npx eslint <changed file(s)>`**, never the whole-repo `npm run lint`, and the acceptance bar is "no NEW errors beyond the named pre-existing ones." ✅

**4. Per-game correctness signal (verified against each file's actual handler):**
| Game | Handler | Correctness expression recorded | Difficulty wired? |
|---|---|---|---|
| ArithmeticGame | `handleSubmit` | `parseInt(inputValue) === currentQuestion.a` | Yes (default from engine; buttons kept) |
| MultiplicationMeteor | `handleSubmit` | `hitMeteorIndex !== -1` | No (fixed generator — §7 forbids content change) |
| FractionFrenzy | `handleOptionClick` | `isCorrect` | No (fixed generator) |
| PatternPuzzle | `handleSelect` | `opt === currentPattern.answer` | Yes (starting matrix difficulty from engine) |
| MultiplicationFarm | `handleAnswer` | `n === q.answer` | No (fixed generator) |
| FractionNinja | `handleSubmit` | `slashed.size === target` | No (fixed generator) |
| DecimalMall | `handleSubmit` | `Math.abs(userAns - q.decimal) < 0.015` (guarded vs NaN) | No (fixed generator) |
| IntegerMountain | `handleSubmit` | `val === q.answer` (guarded vs NaN) | No (fixed generator) |

---

## Open Questions

1. **`usePlayerStore.addXP` engine hook (spec §7 row):** The spec lists "`usePlayerStore.js` — in `addXP`, also call `engine.recordAttempt(...)`". This plan deliberately records **per in-game answer at the call site** instead, because `addXP` fires once per *game session* (not per answer) and the task brief mandates per-answer recording. Recommendation: drop the `addXP` hook entirely (per-answer is strictly better signal), or keep it only as a coarse fallback for the 12 un-integrated games. Confirm with the team before touching `usePlayerStore`.

2. **Two-skill games (`ArithmeticGame`, `FractionNinja`):** We record against the **primary** skill only (`addition`, `fractions-basic`). Should `ArithmeticGame` record `subtraction` when the generated op is `-`, and should `FractionNinja` ever record `equiv-fractions`? Doing so requires reading the per-question op/type — feasible but a slightly larger diff. Deferred; flag if finer per-skill attribution is wanted for the report's mastery heatmap.

3. **`responseTime` for non-typed games:** Option-click and timed games pass `responseTime: 0` (no clean per-question start timestamp without extra state). Only `ArithmeticGame` measures it. Is `responseTime` actually consumed by the BKT backend? (It is recorded to `interaction_log` but BKT ignores it.) If the DKT plan needs it, add per-question `Date.now()` timers to the other 7 games in a follow-up.

4. **Which 8 are the "most-played"?** Spec §10 says integrate the top 8 *most-played* games but the platform has no real usage data yet (cold start). This plan picks a representative spread across skill bands and code styles (typed vs option-click; `useGamification` vs `usePlayerStore`). If the team has a different top-8 in mind (e.g. by grade-band priority), swap the game list — the per-game tasks are independent and the pattern is identical.

5. **PatternPuzzle difficulty mapping (`easy→1, medium→3, hard→5`):** Chosen to map cleanly onto the existing `maxIdx = min(5, 1 + floor(level/2))` ramp (1/3/5 → 1/2/3 pattern types). Confirm these starting points feel right, or tune the map without touching the generator.

6. **Component-test selectors:** The integration tests target buttons by Tailwind class fragments / text patterns (no `data-testid` exists, and §7 forbids adding markup). If a future visual refresh changes those class names, the selectors break. Acceptable for v1; consider negotiating a few `data-testid`s with the design owner if these tests prove brittle.

7. **`MASTERY_UPDATE` payload omits `interactionLog` (Task 3b):** The backend-mastery-sync plan's `/api/sync` accepts both `masteryState` and `interactionLog`, but the engine has no in-memory interaction array to ship (it appends each interaction straight to IndexedDB). We send `masteryState` only; the server's additive merge leaves `interactionLog` at its `[]` default. If the DKT-pipeline or teacher-dashboard plan needs the full server-side interaction sequence, decide whether the producer should also read recent rows via `getInteractionLog()` and attach them — flag the chosen owner so the sequence isn't shipped twice.

8. **One `MASTERY_UPDATE` op per answer = sync-queue volume (Task 3b):** `recordAttempt` now enqueues one op **per in-game answer**, so a 60-second timed game can produce dozens of queued snapshots; each is a full mastery state. `syncEngine` ships them oldest-first and the server merge is idempotent (last-write-wins on `masteryState`), so correctness holds, but the queue can grow offline. Consider (a) coalescing to the latest snapshot before flushing, or (b) keeping it simple for v1 since each op is small and the queue drains on reconnect. Confirm preference; no code change made here.

9. **Error surface of fire-and-forget `recordAttempt` (Task 3b):** Games call `recordAttempt(...)` without `await`/`.catch`. `recordAttempt` now performs three IndexedDB writes (`appendInteraction`, `saveMasteryState`, `pushToSyncQueue`); a rejection in any becomes an unhandled promise rejection in the game. This matches the brief's "fire-and-forget — never await in a UI handler" directive and the pre-existing pattern, but if unhandled rejections become noisy, wrap the call site as `recordAttempt(...).catch(() => {})` (a one-token, content-neutral change) — deferred, flagged for the team.
